# German-Final-scratch-project
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1253776165 this is the link to my final project its a bus trip to school but into a game 

In my project i made a game basically all abokut a school bus on the way to school,and theres pencils and erasers raining down on the bus trying to take it out.

I have a Loop repeating the guide in the beggining of the game to show the arrow that the player needs to use to move forward. 

I used my custom block to display "game over" when the player has lost all their hearts.

I used my conditional for the bus to move forward or backwards for exp if the player presses the key to move forward the bus moves forward if else it goes back.
